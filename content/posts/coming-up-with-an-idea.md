### how to come up with an idea

Here is what I know does not work for me when I am trying to come up with an idea:

- Think very hard until an idea comes to you
- Analyse that idea for problems
- Reject if it has any problems
- Repeat previous steps until exhausted

Here are some rules that work for me a bit better:

- Note down all ideas that you can
- If you particularly like an idea, allow yourself to consider other ideas that flow from that
- Promise yourself you'll have plenty of time to deal with any problems later

### the theme

The theme for this year's Game Off has been released and it is... 🥁... **moonshot**.

Nice. Adding that into the mix of ideas too.

### idea dump ahoy

_Here is a look into what being silly for a while with the above rules in mind looks like._

**LIL' BOAT**

Watch out for the weather

- Sunscreen importante (thank you, Baz)
- Raincoat for if it rains
- Don’t want to catch cold, brrr shivers

Don’t forget to pack phnackph

- Islands? Snack shops?
- Foraging for berries and climbing trees!
- Passage through island hanging snacks (rivers or cliffs)

The way you make ship go forward depends on what music is playing

- Learn new music at new islands
- Learn new music through achievements

Suck up fog make clouds

How does the fog get sucked up into clouds?

- Steampunk device
- Tiny reverse dragon
- Grill at the front of the boooat, cloud farter at the back of the booooat
- Slower when sucking up fog and it costs energy
- Or faster when sucking up fog and pulled towards where you’re sucking from

Flying airship! Game in de clouds!

WHAT WOULD A REVERSE FOG CLOUD DRAGON POOP!? Maybe [foehn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind).

**TAPPY BOAT**

How does the boat move around? What does it look like?

- Lil booooat instrument motors
- Maybe starts as peddle boat and the peddles are keyboards
- Add a sail here that’s actually a tuba
- Oars that are cymbals
- Petrol motor that’s bass guitar/double bass/an amp for everything else
- A leg on a spring that somehow launches the lil boat up into the air and forwards (bass drum followed by crash cymbal)
- Accordion (already funny by nature)
- A comically large character who points behind the ship and blows them forward by whistling daintily
- One of the old parpy boats (steam chimney)
  - Sheep that looks like a cloud gets stuck in parper and you have to do something to shoot the sheep out

Who else is in the sea?

- Dolphins who want to play with you
- Beluga whale with a rugby ball
- Robot whale bleeps
- Other players
- Big boats that can be jammed with
- Party islands constantly playing music

Weather stuff

- The world has extremes of weather, this area is too foggy and dark and eerie, this area is too sunny and harsh, this area is too windy, this area is becalmed. Bring weather elements from an area that doesn't need it to an area that does.
- The moon affects the tides directly and the weather indirectly
- The moon affects some characters/animals/plants and makes them behave differently, kicking off these weather changes

Some people like the weather the way it is
- Smugglers like the cover of fog
- Solar energy collectors and battery farmers like harsh sunlight
- Smelly people/animals/vegetables like the wind for blowing the smell away
- The becalmed zone is full of stranded evil tone-deaf pirates who get freed if it gets windy (maybe they've been there for so long that they're zombie pirates by now)

The moon caused the weather changes

- The islands are the moon islands, and someone messed up a rite to honour the moon so it got angry and replaced the good weather with bad
- The islands are in an archipelago shaped like the moon, but in recent years erosion or climate change have broken down part of the moon shape that was key for stable weather. It can't be brought back, but something can be built to restore the stable weather, if you work hard enough (and have enough fun)

### putting some of that together

There is more than enough to get started with here. It looks like we even have a working title. Here we go, let's try to put a game sizzle blurb together from that content:

> Announcing... TAPPY BOAT! A musical adventure on the high seas. Bop 'til you drop, and don't lose your rhythm, the islanders are counting on you to send out the good tunes and bring back the good times! Build your boat and add new instruments to jam with your neighbours and strangers alike. Free the islands from their glum foggy doom.

Hmmm. Not great, not awful... _Just good enough!_

Let's go try and make something out of this!
