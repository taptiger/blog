### outlets

- [Official forum](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020/community)
- [Official discord](https://discord.gg/ktN4wrcKHt)
- [r/indiegames](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/) welcomes any post about an in-development game so long as it shows gameplay.
  - _"Make sure to post an animated gif/gfycat/webm or screenshots (imgur album) with your post so we can see what the game is about. Youtube vids also welcome."_
- [r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/) is for discussion around the topic of game development. It's generally dismissive of self-promo and has a bit of a chip on the shoulder problem. There are a few themed mono-threads that may be worth adding to a calendar:
  - [[FF] Feedback Friday](https://goo.gl/fkKfck) for when you have an actually playable version of the game available to playtest
  - [[SS] Screenshot Saturday](https://goo.gl/ov5mbo) with twitter tag #screenshotsaturday is for blurbs plus screens, accessible early
  - [[STS] Soundtrack Sunday](https://goo.gl/hhnsrT) recommends you post for feedback via SoundCloud and gets surprisingly little traffic
  - [[WIPW] WIP Wednesday](https://goo.gl/bDY5KN) with twitter tag #WIPWednesday seems to be a catch all for posting videos or demos or whatever, and also gets low engagement
- My own twitter for everything and anything (including related hashtags) if I ever get unlocked
- My own blog (here) if I ever get images rendering
