What is the smallest version of this game that I can possibly make? I touched on this already in my post on [setting a goal](../setting-a-goal):

> it has some form of input interface, and there exists a win state which is not the default state

Ok, not inspiring, but let's at least get that far using Godot.

### requirements v0.1

1. There is a blue background
2. There is a brown player character (tappy boat)
3. There is an input button that makes the boat go 'up'
4. You achieve winstate if you make the boat go 'up' to the top of the screen and cross an invisible finish line

Go! 🏁

...I'm going to have to take a tutorial or two.
